A constructor in C++ is a special method that is automatically called when an object of a class is created.
A constructor has the same name as the class name. 
It has no return type.
It is a public type.
It can be defined inside of a class or outside of a class. 

/* Constructor in C++ */

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Constructor
{
  private:
  
  public:
         Constructor()
         {
         cout << "This is Constructor" << endl;
         }
  
};


int main()
{
 Constructor C1;
 
   
    return 0;
}
